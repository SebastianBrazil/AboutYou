    <p class="fontLu">My name is Sebastian Breve-Sanchez</p>
    <p class="fontLu closerTop">This is a page with information about me</p>

    <br>

    <p class="colorWh">I made the ultimate skill issue of being born. This happened on September 15th, 2005</p>
    <p class="colorWh closerTop">I have a mixed nationality:</p>
    <ul class="colorWh closerTop">
        <li>My mom is from Honduras, in central America</li>
        <li>My dad is from Mexico, Michoac√°n to be specific</li>
        <li>Then I was born in the United States</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="colorYe">I used to play video games quite a lot when I was younger, but have significantly slowed down as
        of late. Its not so much that I don't like playing games, its just that there are no good games that get
        released anymore. What I'm most likly to play when I'm in the mood to game is, in order:</p>
    <ol class="colorYe closerTop">
        <li>Hearts of Iron 4</li>
        <li>Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts</li>
        <li>Baldur's Gate 3, a recent game that I quite enjoy but still don't play often</li>
        <li>Stellaris</li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <p class="colorOr">Instead, I spend most of my time taking walks. I took plenty of hours-long walks over the
        two-week break, but now that school has restarted I'll only have time to do that during the weekends. During the
        week, when I'm not in school, I spend my time with working out or practicing archery.</p>

        you would want to see it, I do not know.</p>

        <p>I also love building legos. Here is my pride and joy:</p>

        <p>It took me months to assemble and I've had it for about two years now.</p>
